Coconut milk, coconut milk, absolutely delicious it is! I love Nekopara, and you should too.

To work hard, you must play hard. That's why we do cool things like this. Now check out some code

.. code-block:: csharp
  :linenos:

  public Color4 ColorLerp(Color4 a, Color4 b, float blend)
  {
      var vectorColorA = new Vector3(a.R,a.G,a.B);
      var vectorColorB = new Vector3(b.R,b.G,b.B);
      var v = Vector3.Lerp(vectorColorA,vectorColorB,blend);
      return new Color4(v.X,v.Y,v.Z,255);
  }

Thank you!

Where Do I Go From Here?
------------------------

I don't know, you tell me. Ain't the sky the limit for you people?

Well...
^^^^^^^

Well, what? Don't keep me waiting all this time! I have important matters to handle, such as feeding my shinobi children! They get hungry, and they need to exceed a certain bust size to bust out of heists and moves. That's the life of a shinobi these days. No more carefree Naruto.
