The Gateway
===========
So now you've reached this point. Congratulations! Take a look back at how much we've mastered so far. It's actually quite a lot. But in the grand scheme of things, there's a lot more you can still learn! If this is an MMORPG, this would be the completion of the novice class, with us ready to enter the specialized disciplines. If this is a visual novel, this would be completing the common route, where we get an idea about the setting, the premise, and now we get a teaser for the girls (or guys for you otome fans!) to pursue.

But Why? Why Bother Expanding?
==============================
"Scripting is pretty useful," you say, "I can whip up a relatively nice storyboard pretty quick, and with :term:`Easing`, it can look pretty lit." So then, you ponder, "Why should I spend more time when I already have a perfectly good set of skills trained down?" You can ask the same question if you're in the Novice class in an MMORPG. You can continue questing, crafting, and trying to be the best there is, but do realize that in those subsequent class promotions, more options become available to you, built upon the foundations made before.

Here are a few reasons why it might be useful to pick up one of these mediums to storyboard.

Macroscopic Magic
-----------------
When learning arithmetics, we first went through the very basics â€” think addition and subtraction. Upon those building blocks, we've (hopefully) mastered concepts such as multiplication, division, negative numbers, and fractions. From those blocks, algebra gets introduced, where all of these concepts begin coming together for critical thinking. When we reach such a level, those very basic building blocks have been continuously honed upon and harnessed that they become like clockwork. At that point, we can think of things on a higher level, solving new problems and widening our horizon of what's possible.

   In order to become a master character designer at Eagle Jump, you must first go through plenty of hoops.

The same applies to storyboarding. Those scripting commands we've first learned are just like our addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations in mathematics. Such commands can be considered our *primitive operations*. While it's important to understand how these operations work, in order to display and perform much more grandiose visual arts of wizardry, it's simply not practical to only stick with these operations. It'd be a nightmare to graph parabolic functions by manually charting out each point.

Consider the 3D bird displayed in Damnae's masterful storyboard far east nightbird (kors k remix). Trying to calculate, feel for, and consider each edge of the bird would require knowing the coordinate of hundreds of points at a time. And then again, since it rotated a little bit. *And again*. Obviously, this implementation is simply impractical with direct scripting, yet the 3D makeup is composed of these very commands. In actuality, it's thanks to :term:`osu!SGL` that this is possible. By having more options available that take advantage of these primitive operations, we can create far higher visuals that wewren't practical before.

Putting the "Fun" in Programming Fundamentals
---------------------------------------------
In Minecraft, the introduction of Redstone and logic gates allowed players to create their own contraptions in far elaborate scale. Start off with simple light switches and trapdoors, but with enough effort and fun, grow to create elaborate moats, dungeon systems, and even calculators and computers. Kids didn't know it, but for each redstone circuit they're creating, they're mastering the basics of engineering and digital logic. And, most importantly, it's fun.

   Some people just see this as some redstone ore. I see it as my bae's first time... mining redstone in Minecraft.

Programming can often times be dry for many the apprentice's tastes. But then a new opportunity arises! "Wouldn't it be cool to make this bombastic explosion of particles?! What are the steps to do that?" And thus, storyboarding can be a great bridge to help begin that programming journey. If you're planning to learn computer science down the line, why not gain that extra edge and flex your muscles with an interest that you're already in? Even if computer science doesn't sound like something you're interested in the future, the knowledge of programming can be incredibly versatile. Need to approximate or make repetitive calculations or patterns? We got your back. The concepts you learn in this level of storyboarding can be applied in so many other applications, that the sky is pretty much the limit! The critical thinking gained from learning programming is invaluable.

Efficiency and Sanity
---------------------
Consider this scenario: you are storyboarding lyrics for a song. As such, the first step is to then break down all the lyrics into their own individual images. Making it easier on yourself, you come up with a naming system: an additive number system beginning from 0, counting 1 up. Straightforward. So then you're copy-pasting each line to their own image, trimming the text images of their transparency, and saving based on the new intuitive number system. Swell!

   Handmade, circa 2010. When tools like this didn't even exist.

Time to get those handmade lyrics images put up onto the storyboard. Sounds good! So that's creating the sprite, then having some simple move and fade command transitioning in and out. There's like, 20-30 of them, so we'd need to copy and paste all of those for convenience. But make sure to change each of the filenames to each lyric file! Don't want to have the incorrect one sprout up. Now it's a matter of changing the times to the correct ones, figuring out both the entry and ending offsets for each lyric bit.

When all of that is said and done, phew! How long must have that taken? Without distractions, it certainly must've been at least a couple of hours. And, as each step had to have been done manually, it may not have been perfect the entire way. Errors could have been made along the way. For instance, what if you accidentally cut-off text? Accidentally skipped a number? And so on.

OK. The ball's in :term:`storybrew`'s court now. What can it do? Well... Lyrics can be generated from a subtitles file, the same kind that fansubbers make for their favorite anime. Paired up with the song, you copy and paste each line to each section of the song, no problem. Then on storybrew, you just add the Lyrics effect, import the subtitles file, then find the best font and other little embellishments to make your text look pretty. And there we go! That's it. Add other adjustments and polish by editing the script manually.

How long must have that taken? Probably less than a half-hour.

Spend less time working on all the manual labor. Let programming carry you through the boring stuff, so you have more time and power to work on cooler things that are far more impressive.

  Sometimes the quest for efficiency takes over your sanity though.
