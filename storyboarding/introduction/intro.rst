Where Should I Begin!?

"Gosh darn it. I have no idea where to start." This could be the thought running through your head (maybe with more expletives) when you're *interested* in storyboarding, but feel overwhelmed at where to begin. Hopefully, this little section can help steer you in the right direction.

A lot of the learning curve associated with storyboarding can come from your background and prior knowledge with programming. While you can create amazing storyboards without programming, such as using the Design Editor, programming helps accelerate development by generating art at more efficiency. Instead of you manually building the blocks of a pyramid, you can tell a computer to do it for you.

If you already have a programming background, then we highly recommend using `storybrew <https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew/wiki>`_, which uses C#. You can also develop your own libraries in your favorite language as well, but storybrew offers advantages such as having a modular framework for storyboard effects, dynamic file updates, quick configurable parameters, and text sprite rendering. While developing your own library is often a good exercise, there are times where you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

If you don't have a programming background, then that's totally OK! In that case, you'd want to get started with Scripting first. You'll first learn how to create your own sprites on the screen, what sort of things you can tell the sprites to do, and then put it all together to create something quite stellar! After that, you can move on to creating storyboards in any medium you so desire, which even includes learning programming.
