.. todo:: Hiss hiss. So what should we do here? Wafu's guide would be helpful, and basically everything from that guide could be plastered here. However, there are some general pages that could be useful. Here's my thoughts:

    - Some gentle example to get someone into the ropes of storyboarding with Python would be a good thought. (Getting Started, essentially)
    - But otherwise, offering Python tutorials would be pretty much the way to go.
    - Specific python libraries such as PIL or mathmetical ones could be written about more in a generalized manner.
