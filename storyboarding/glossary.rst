    Osu! Storyboarder Banquet
        A community of storyboarders founded by Exile- and BetaStar. The goals for the server are not only to help promote storyboarding to many osu! players, but also to help others learn and improve their own storyboards. Some also believe that the server's true intention is to be a shrine worshipping the great deity Hifumi.

    BetaBot
        The automated bot that runs in :term:`Osu! Storyboarder Banquet`'s Discord server. Is often nicknamed as Hifumi. Contains the cutest twintails his momma BetaStar can find.

    Hifumi Takimoto : Hifumi
    滝本ひふみ
        A character designer at Eagle Jump, the fictional game development company from Doga Kobo's *New Game!*. She is actually a goddess and is immediately SS best #1 tier girl. Words cannot sufficiently describe how succulently brilliant our goddess is, but most certainly she is the affectionate mascot for :term:`Osu! Storyboarder Banquet`. Her shyness exudes cuteness, and her beauty mark is a crown over those ill-suited three-dimensional women who cannot compare.
